Hello, this is my fourth(actually third but yk) submission for web development basics

I basiacally just followed the tutorials and implemented the things shown in the tutorials.
Sometimes I also tried to add some small little features cause it was just a fitting moment for that.
Towards the end (the part where I wanted to implement more of my own stuff and turn in into my own webside) I stumbles across multiple mistakes/errors that made my life really hard and made it a bit frustrating to work on because I had to redo a lot. 

Neverthesless the plan or the finished webside should be a collection of Ideas for people who dont have an Idea what project to do (like me) I am far from finished but will keep up my work
